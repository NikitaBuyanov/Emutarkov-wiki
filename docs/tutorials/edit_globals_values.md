# Change some traders behaviour
## Requirements
For doing **any** edits in EmuTarkov i higly recommend you to use this software :
* [VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/releases)

This software is free and alot more helpfull for alot of things, like missing coma and everything about the syntax.
* Make a backup of the profile you're using.

For this, heads to `ServerFolder/db/` make a backup of** globals.json** file and [create a mod](tutorials/create_a_mod) with the **globals.json** file in it.


**⚠️ If you want to make any changes, close both the game and the server, none of these should run ⚠️ .**

* [Change minimum level for flea market](tutorials/edit_globals_values.md#Change-minimum-level-for-flea-market)

* [Change stamina stuff](tutorials/edit_globals_values.md#Change-stamina-stuff)
* [Change weight stuff](tutorials/edit_globals_values.md#Change-weight-stuff)
