## Can i play with friends on EmuTarkov ?
Having the ability to play with your friends on EmuTarkov means having a online server working and would lead to legal issues with BSG. For avoiding the project to get closed by BSG crew, **EmuTarkov will never holds multiplayers features and ability**. So no you will not be able to play with your friends using EmuTarkov.
